# AI Memory Batches

This directory contains batch files generated by `smart-chunker.js`.

## Workflow

1. Run `node tools/smart-chunker.js` to generate batch files
2. Each batch contains up to 100k characters of source code
3. Process each batch with AI to extract knowledge
4. Save outputs to `../outputs/` directory
5. Run `node tools/merge-memory.js` to consolidate

## Files

- `batch-XXX.txt` - Source code batches for processing
- `manifest.json` - Batch metadata and file listings

## Do Not Edit

These files are auto-generated. They will be overwritten on next run of smart-chunker.
