fix(tests): Vitest harness stabilization + tenant guard + syntax cleanup (FIX-001/006/007)

CRITICAL TEST FIXES (100% Execution Mode - Session 2025-12-18T00:00)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FIX-001 (REAPPLIED): Vitest Worker Isolation
────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: vitest.config.ts STILL had singleThread:true (285+ test failures)
Root Cause: Previous session claimed fix but code was never changed OR reverted
Fix: Restored bounded threads (minThreads:1, maxThreads:4) at sharedProjectConfig
Impact: Unblocks full test suite (target <50 failures from 285)
Evidence: aggregateWithTenantScope tests 6/6 passing
Files: vitest.config.ts:21-26

FIX-006: Tenant Guard Validation Strengthening (SECURITY)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: aggregateWithTenantScope accepted empty string orgId → tenant leak
Previous: if (!orgId) check (empty string passes)
Fix: Added typeof and trim() checks to reject empty/whitespace
Impact: Zero-tolerance tenant isolation enforcement
Files: lib/db/aggregateWithTenantScope.ts:25-27

FIX-007: Syntax Error Cleanup (ProductsList + PropertiesList)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: Orphaned filter code causing TS1128/TS1005 errors (14 errors)
Root Cause: Incomplete deletion during parallel agent filter refactoring
Fix: Removed duplicate filters.push() blocks between quickChips and columns
Impact: TypeScript 0 errors
Files: 
  - components/marketplace/ProductsList.tsx (removed 45 lines)
  - components/aqar/PropertiesList.tsx (removed 70 lines)

VERIFICATION:
- pnpm typecheck → 0 errors (was 14+ syntax errors)
- aggregateWithTenantScope.test.ts → 6/6 passing
- marketplace/cart.route.test.ts → 8/8 passing

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS (Code Already Correct):
- Marketplace context: ALREADY has VITEST guard (lines 98-110)
- Security monitoring: ALREADY checks VITEST_WORKER_ID (line 260)
- vitest.setup.ts: ALREADY has connection guards (lines 555-575)
- Filter components: 6 components refactored by parallel agent (GOOD)

PARALLEL AGENT WORK (Included):
- Extracted query builders from 6 list components (testability improvement)
- Added 3 test files for component testing
