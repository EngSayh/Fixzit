# Archived Documentation

This directory now contains the historical material that previously cluttered
the top-level `docs/` folder. These references remain searchable, but the
default workflow should point to the active guides highlighted in
[`../current/README.md`](../current/README.md).

## Working With the Archive

- Keep these files immutable; create new documents in topical folders instead.
- Reference archived documents when you need chronological context or evidence
  for a decision.
- When converting an archived plan into an active initiative, create a new file
  under the relevant active folder and link back here for provenance.
