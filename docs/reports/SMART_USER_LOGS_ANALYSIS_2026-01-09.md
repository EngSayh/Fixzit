## SMART Report: Superadmin User Logs Review and Improvement Analysis

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-0012]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** Fixzit-v2.0.27-20260109-0042-test-100-percent
**Status:** Complete

### Specific
Review superadmin user-logs UI and supporting APIs (user-logs, user-logs/stats, user-sessions) to identify data contract gaps, UX issues, and operational risks; deliver improvement and testing recommendations for the page.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Files reviewed | 0 | 4 | 4 | OK |
| Contract mismatches identified | 0 | 3 | 4 | OK |
| Report artifacts created | 0 | 1 | 1 | OK |
| Local verification commands | 0 | 2 | 2 | OK |

### Achievable
Scope is limited to a single page and three API routes with direct code access; existing patterns allow rapid mapping of UI expectations to API payloads.

### Relevant
Correct audit-log visibility is critical for compliance, incident response, and support operations; mismatched contracts and demo fallbacks can mislead superadmin decisions.

### Time-bound
Complete within this session (2026-01-09, Asia/Riyadh).
