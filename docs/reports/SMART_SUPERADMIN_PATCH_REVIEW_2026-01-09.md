## SMART Report: Superadmin Patch Review (User Logs + Roles)

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-0012]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** Fixzit-v2.0.27-20260109-0042-test-100-percent
**Status:** Complete

### Specific
Review recent superadmin patches focused on user logs and roles (UI + API) and document correctness, risks, and test gaps.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Files reviewed | 0 | 7 | 7 | OK |
| Findings logged | 0 | 5 | 6 | OK |
| Verification commands | 0 | 2 | 2 | OK |
| Lint/typecheck errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | OK |

### Achievable
Scope is limited to superadmin UI/API routes with direct diffs and existing tests; code paths are readable and reviewable in-session.

### Relevant
User logs and role auditing are compliance and security critical; regressions here reduce incident response and auditability.

### Time-bound
Complete within this session (2026-01-09, Asia/Riyadh).
