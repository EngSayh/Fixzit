## SMART Report: Superadmin Roles Page Review

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-0013]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** Fixzit-v2.0.27-20260109-0042-test-100-percent
**Status:** In Progress

### Specific
Review /superadmin/roles UI and related superadmin roles APIs, identify UX/logic/bug risks, attempt runtime access, and record verification evidence.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| UI page reviewed in code (app/superadmin/roles/page.tsx) | 0 | 1 | 1 | Done |
| API routes reviewed (roles, roles/[id], roles/bulk-update) | 0 | 3 | 3 | Done |
| Runtime access with superadmin auth | 0 | 1 | 0 | Blocked |
| Verification commands run (typecheck, lint) | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |
| Evidence captured (HTTP status checks) | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |

### Achievable
Repo contains the page and API sources, and local server is reachable. Authenticated UI access requires a superadmin session cookie, which is not available in this session.

### Relevant
Roles and permissions are core RBAC controls for the superadmin portal; mismatches or UI errors can misrepresent access scopes and undermine auditability.

### Time-bound
Complete analysis and reporting in this session (2026-01-09).
