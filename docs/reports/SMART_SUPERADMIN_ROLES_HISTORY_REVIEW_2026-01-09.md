## SMART Report: Superadmin Roles History Patch Review

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-TEMP-20260109T1537]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** Fixzit-v2.0.27-20260109-0042-test-100-percent
**Status:** In Progress

### Specific
Review the superadmin roles history API route and its tests to validate query logic, role name extraction, and test coverage; document risks and recommended fixes.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Files reviewed | 0 | 2 | 2 | OK |
| Findings documented | 0 | 4 | 4 | OK |
| TypeScript errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | OK |
| Lint errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | OK |
| SSOT issues logged | 0 | 1 | 0 | Blocked |

### Achievable
Scope is limited to one API route and one test file with direct code access; local verification tools are available and completed.

### Relevant
Role history drives auditability and compliance for superadmin actions; incorrect filtering or weak tests can hide missing audit entries and regressions.

### Time-bound
Complete within this session (2026-01-09, Asia/Riyadh).
