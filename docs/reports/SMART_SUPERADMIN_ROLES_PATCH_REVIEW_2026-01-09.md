## SMART Report: Superadmin Roles Patch Review

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-0013]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** Fixzit-v2.0.27-20260109-0042-test-100-percent
**Status:** In Progress

### Specific
Review the superadmin roles patch set (roles history UI + history API), validate with local typecheck/lint, and log findings to SSOT.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Files reviewed | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |
| SSOT findings logged | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |
| Typecheck errors | 0 | 0 | 3 | Blocked |
| Lint errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | Done |

### Achievable
Changes are localized to two files and can be verified with local typecheck/lint and SSOT issue logging.

### Relevant
Roles history is a superadmin audit surface; build or data-shape defects reduce trust and block releases.

### Time-bound
Complete review and SSOT logging in this session (2026-01-09).
