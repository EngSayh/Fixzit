## SMART Report: Superadmin User Logs Page Review and Patch Audit

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-TEMP-20260109T1333]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** Fixzit-v2.0.27-20260109-0042-test-100-percent
**Status:** In Progress

### Specific
Review the /superadmin/user-logs page and its supporting APIs (user-logs, export, stats, user-sessions) plus recently modified superadmin user detail/audit tests to identify contract mismatches, logic risks, and UX gaps; deliver improvement and testing recommendations.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Files reviewed | 0 | 7 | 7 | OK |
| Findings documented | 0 | 5 | 5 | OK |
| TypeScript errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | OK |
| Lint errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | OK |
| SSOT issues logged | 0 | 1 | 0 | Blocked |

### Achievable
Scope is limited to one page, four API routes, and two modified files with direct code access; local validation tools are available and completed.

### Relevant
Accurate user activity visibility is critical for compliance, incident response, and support; contract mismatches or lenient tests can hide data integrity regressions.

### Time-bound
Complete within this session (2026-01-09, Asia/Riyadh).
