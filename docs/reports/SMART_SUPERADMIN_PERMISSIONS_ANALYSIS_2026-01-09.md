## SMART Report: Superadmin Permissions Page Analysis

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-0016]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** main
**Status:** In Progress

### Specific
Review /superadmin/permissions page UI and related API routes for functional gaps, data-model mismatches, RBAC correctness, and test coverage. Produce prioritized improvement recommendations and a bug/logic catalog.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Page reviewed | 0 | 1 | 1 | OK |
| API routes reviewed (roles, bulk-update, roles/[id], roles/history) | 0 | 4 | 4 | OK |
| Tests reviewed (roles-history) | 0 | 1 | 1 | OK |
| Preflight checks (git fetch, typecheck, lint) | 0 | 3 | 3 | OK |
| SSOT update with report path | 0 | 1 | 0 | BLOCKED |

### Achievable
Existing UI and API code is in repo; static analysis is sufficient. Preflight checks ran locally. SSOT update requires ISSUE_API_TOKEN access.

### Relevant
Permissions management is a high-risk admin workflow; mismatches here affect access control, auditability, and support load.

### Time-bound
Complete within this session once SSOT logging and (optional) live UI verification are available.
