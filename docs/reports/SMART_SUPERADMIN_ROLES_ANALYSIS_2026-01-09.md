## SMART Report: Superadmin Roles Page Analysis

**Agent Token:** [AGENT-0015]
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Branch:** main
**Status:** In Progress

### Specific
Review `/superadmin/roles` UI and its supporting APIs (`/api/superadmin/roles`, `/api/superadmin/roles/history`) to identify UX, logic, and data-shape risks; attempt runtime access; capture verification evidence.

### Measurable
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| UI page reviewed in code (`app/superadmin/roles/page.tsx`) | 0 | 1 | 1 | Done |
| API routes reviewed (`/api/superadmin/roles`, `/api/superadmin/roles/history`) | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |
| Tests reviewed (page + roles history) | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |
| Runtime unauthenticated status checks (page + 2 APIs) | 0 | 3 | 3 | Done |
| Authenticated UI validation (superadmin session) | 0 | 1 | 0 | Blocked |
| Verification commands run (typecheck, lint) | 0 | 2 | 2 | Done |

### Achievable
Sources and tests are available locally; runtime validation is feasible once a superadmin session cookie is provided or the dev server is confirmed running.

### Relevant
Roles and permissions are core RBAC controls; incorrect UI or data mapping can mislead admins and create audit/compliance gaps.

### Time-bound
Complete analysis and reporting in this session (2026-01-09).
