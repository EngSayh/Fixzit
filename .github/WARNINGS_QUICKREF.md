# 🚨 VSCode Workflow Warnings - Quick Reference

## TL;DR
✅ Secrets are now required and configured in GitHub/Vercel  
✅ “Context access might be invalid” hints should disappear after reloading VSCode  
🔧 If they linger, re-authenticate the GitHub Actions extension and reload the window

---

## If you still see warnings
- Confirm you pulled the latest workflows (no more fallback placeholders).
- Ensure VSCode is signed into GitHub and the Actions extension is enabled.
- Reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window`).
- Share a screenshot if warnings persist so we can reproduce.
