## AI Memory System

This repository uses a manual "AI Memory" system stored in `ai-memory/`:

- `ai-memory/batches/` – XML batches generated by `tools/smart-chunker.js`.
- `ai-memory/outputs/` – JSON summaries generated via Inline Chat.
- `ai-memory/master-index.json` – merged, deduped index of the entire codebase.

Each entry in `master-index.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "file": "src/api/auth/login/route.ts",
  "category": "routes",
  "summary": "Short technical description of the file.",
  "exports": ["POST"],
  "dependencies": ["@lib/db", "@lib/auth"]
}
```

### When answering architecture or cross-cutting questions:

1. **Always consult `ai-memory/master-index.json` first.**
2. Use it to identify relevant file paths based on:
   - `file`
   - `category`
   - `summary`
   - `exports` / `dependencies`
3. Then load those specific files via:
   - Direct references (for example: `#src/api/auth/login/route.ts`), or
   - Targeted `#codebase` searches for those paths.

**Do not assume the entire repo is in context at once. Work from the index.**

### When performing refactors or feature work:

1. Use `ai-memory/master-index.json` to:
   - Find all related routes, models, components, and utilities.
   - Understand dependencies before changing anything.
   - Propose a clear, step-by-step plan before editing files.
2. Generate:
   - Updated code,
   - Minimal but meaningful tests,
   - A short note about impacted modules.

### Maintenance Hint

If `ai-memory/master-index.json` appears outdated (for example, after large structural changes or after several weeks of development), recommend re-running:

```bash
node tools/smart-chunker.js
# Inline Chat over the new batches (Ctrl+I / Cmd+I)
node tools/merge-memory.js
```

## Core Rules

- Always work in a new feature branch named `feat/<task>` or `fix/<issue>` or `agent/<timestamp>`
- **NEVER push to `main` or `master` directly**
- After changes compile and tests pass, open a PR with clear title and summary
- Use `gh pr create --fill --draft` to create draft PRs
- All changes must go through Pull Request review

## Workflow

1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feat/<task-name>`
2. Make changes
3. Verify: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`
4. Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "feat: description"`
5. Push: `git push -u origin HEAD`
6. Open PR: `gh pr create --fill --draft`

## Never Do

- Direct commits to main/master
- Force pushes to protected branches
- Modify `.env*` files without explicit instruction
- Change layout/TopBar/Sidebar without approval

## Auto-Approve Policy

- This workspace has auto-approve enabled for agent actions
- All terminal commands and file edits are pre-approved
- Focus on delivering working code through PRs

## Comprehensive Execution Rules Framework

### A. Scope Completeness

- **Complete all pending tasks** - Don't stop at partial implementation
- **Find similar issues system-wide** - If you fix one bug, search for the same pattern elsewhere
- **Work on ALL, no exceptions** - When asked to add features/translations/fixes, complete 100%
- **No prioritization without permission** - Let user decide priority, don't create "Priority 1/2/3" lists

### B. Crash-Proofing

- **Check memory before large operations** - Prevent VS Code error code 5 (out of memory)
- **Use pagination for large datasets** - Don't load 1000+ records at once
- **Implement graceful degradation** - Handle failures without crashing
- **Add error boundaries** - Wrap components in ErrorBoundary for React

### C. Production-Only Standards

- **No mockups or placeholders** - All code must be production-ready
- **No TODOs or FIXMEs** - Complete implementation or don't commit
- **Fix root causes, not symptoms** - Don't apply band-aids
- **Real data, real integrations** - No fake data or mocked APIs (unless specifically for testing)

### D. File Organization & Hygiene

- **Organize by domain** - Group related files (e.g., `/finance/*`, `/hr/*`)
- **Eliminate duplicates** - Search for similar code before creating new files
- **Follow naming conventions** - Use established patterns (e.g., `kebab-case` for files)
- **Clean up after yourself** - Remove dead code, unused imports, deprecated files

### E. Issue Discovery & Registration

- **Search entire repo** - Use grep, semantic search to find similar issues
- **Catalog in Issues Register** - Document all issues found (`ISSUES_REGISTER.md`)
- **Categorize by type** - Security, Correctness, Reliability, Performance, UX, i18n, Data, API, Build, Tests, Docs
- **Assign severity** - 🟥 Critical, 🟧 Major, 🟨 Moderate, 🟩 Minor

### F. Pattern Generalization

- **Fix everywhere, not just one place** - If issue exists in multiple files, fix all
- **Create reusable utilities** - Extract common patterns into shared functions
- **Document patterns** - Add comments explaining why code is structured a certain way
- **Establish conventions** - Create templates for common tasks (e.g., translation keys: `module.category.key`)

### G. Verification Gates (ALWAYS RUN)

- **Build/Compile**: `pnpm build` or `pnpm typecheck` - Must pass with 0 errors
- **Linting**: `pnpm lint` - Must pass with 0 errors (warnings acceptable if documented)
- **Type Checking**: `pnpm typecheck` - Must pass with 0 TypeScript errors
- **Tests**: `pnpm test` - All tests must pass, no skipped tests without justification
- **UI Smoke Test**: Manual verification that UI loads and functions work
- **Performance Check**: No page should take >30s to load
- **Stability Check**: No crashes during normal operation

### H. Reporting Requirements

- **Daily Report**: Create timestamped report in `docs/archived/DAILY_PROGRESS_REPORTS/`
  - What changed (with line numbers and file paths)
  - Why changes were made (root cause, user request)
  - Where changes were made (file paths, commit SHAs)
  - Test/build results
  - Performance checks
  - Stability confirmation
- **To-Do List**: Maintain active todo list with clear status (not-started, in-progress, completed)
- **Issues Register**: Update `ISSUES_REGISTER.md` with all discovered issues
- **Similar Issues Resolved**: Document pattern fixes applied system-wide

### I. Final Delivery Standards

- **One polished output** - Not multiple iterations or drafts
- **Production-ready code** - Can be deployed immediately
- **Complete documentation** - README, inline comments, API docs
- **No shortcuts** - Full implementation, no half-measures
- **All verification gates passed** - See section G above

---

## Style & Quality Expectations

- No placeholders (TODO, TBD, fake data) in final suggested code.
- Respect existing TypeScript types and patterns already in the repo.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid unnecessary rewrites.
- Preserve domain boundaries (FM, Marketplace, Shared Services, etc.).
- Prefer small, well-named functions and clear separation of concerns.

---

## Translation System Guidelines

### Key Naming Conventions

- **Use namespaced keys**: `module.category.key` (e.g., `finance.payment.bankName`)
- **Avoid unnamespaced keys**: Don't use `"Bank Name"` directly as a key
- **Consistent prefixes**: All keys in a module should start with same prefix (e.g., `finance.*`)

### Adding New Translations

1. **Add to both EN and AR catalogs** - Maintain 100% parity
2. **Professional translations** - No machine translation, culturally appropriate
3. **Run audit before commit**: `node scripts/audit-translations.mjs`
4. **Fix gaps immediately**: Use `--fix` flag if needed
5. **Update artifacts**: Regenerate `translation-audit.json` and `translation-audit.csv`

### Translation Audit

- **Run audit script**: `node scripts/audit-translations.mjs`
- **Check for gaps**: Ensure "Catalog Parity: ✅ OK" and "Code Coverage: ✅ All used keys present"
- **Review dynamic keys**: Template literals `t(\`${expr}\`)` flagged as UNSAFE_DYNAMIC need manual review
- **Generate reports**: JSON/CSV artifacts for analysis

---

## Module-Specific Rules

### Finance Module

- **All monetary values** - Use `Decimal` type, not `number`
- **Currency handling** - Always include currency code (e.g., `{ amount: 100, currency: 'OMR' }`)
- **Audit trail** - Log all financial transactions with timestamp, user, amount
- **Double-entry accounting** - Every transaction must have balancing debit/credit entries

### HR Module

- **PII protection** - Encrypt sensitive employee data
- **Role-based access** - Verify permissions before showing employee details
- **Audit logging** - Track all HR actions (hire, terminate, salary change)

### Property Management (Aqar)

- **Location data** - Always include coordinates for properties
- **Unit hierarchy** - Maintain parent-child relationships (Property > Building > Floor > Unit)
- **Occupancy tracking** - Keep accurate vacancy/occupancy status

### Work Orders

- **SLA tracking** - Calculate and update SLA status on every status change
- **Priority inheritance** - Critical properties get critical work orders by default
- **Auto-assignment** - Assign to vendor based on category and availability

---

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript

- **Strict mode enabled** - No implicit any, proper types for all variables
- **Interface over type** - Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections
- **Avoid `any`** - Use `unknown` or proper types
- **Null safety** - Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)

### React

- **Functional components only** - No class components
- **Hooks for state** - Use `useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks
- **Error boundaries** - Wrap route components in ErrorBoundary
- **Accessibility** - Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Performance

- **Lazy loading** - Use `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for large components
- **Memoization** - Use `useMemo`, `useCallback` for expensive operations
- **Pagination** - Never fetch all records, implement cursor/offset pagination
- **Debouncing** - Debounce search inputs, autocomplete fields

---

## Security Rules

### Authentication

- **Never expose tokens** - Don't log tokens, don't commit tokens
- **HTTP-only cookies** - Store session tokens in secure, HTTP-only cookies
- **CSRF protection** - Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

### Authorization

- **Check permissions server-side** - Never trust client-side role checks
- **Principle of least privilege** - Grant minimum permissions needed
- **Role hierarchy** - SUPER_ADMIN > ADMIN > MANAGER > USER

### Data Protection

- **Encrypt PII** - Encrypt employee SSN, salary, bank accounts
- **Sanitize inputs** - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Rate limiting** - Prevent brute force attacks with rate limits

---

## Constraints for AI Agents

- **Never assume the entire repo is in context** - Use the memory index to load only what is needed
- **Keep diffs minimal and focused** - Don't rewrite domain logic without clear reason
- **No placeholders** - No "TODO", "TBD", or fake data in final suggestions
- **Respect existing patterns** - Use the same TypeScript types and domain boundaries already in use
- **Small, focused functions** - Prefer over large monoliths
- **Follow folder layout** - routes, models, components, utils, core
